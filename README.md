# Unity-ScreenshotTool
Tool for taking general screenshots of the Game window in the Editor.

Specifically has Asset Store images in mind - but great for other stuff too.

## Usage
1. Place within project.
2. Run from "Tools/Screenshot Tool".
3. Optionally, change the MenuItem location string and run from new location.
4. Set to desired resolution and decide if you want to upscale it (2400x1600 for Asset Store by default).
5. Choose save file path for the screenshot (defaults to /assets/)
6. Set the camera to use to render (defaults to default scene cam).
8. Click "Take Screenshot!"
9. Your screenshot will be opened for viewing in your default program.
